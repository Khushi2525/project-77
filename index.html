    <p> Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs,
         as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such 
         as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both 
         native code and managed code. Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as
          well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other
           built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database 
           schema designer.To set up Visual Studio go to this link https://code.visualstudio.com/Download </p>
